## Introduction
Vamak aims to make homemade loan management easy and efficient. Whether you are lending money to a friend or borrowing from a family member, Vamak helps you keep track of loans, set terms, and manage repayments seamlessly. It also incorporates the time value of money to ensure that loans taken earlier are valued appropriately compared to those taken later.

## Features
- **Loan Tracking:** Easily track the status of your loans.
- **Repayment Scheduling:** Set up and manage repayment schedules.
- **Notifications:** Receive notifications for due payments.
- **Reporting:** Generate detailed reports of loan statuses and histories.
- **User Management:** Manage multiple users and their loan agreements.
- **Flexible Loan Amount Representation:** Customize loan amounts to be represented in various formats, such as dollars, gold, or other units.
- **Time Value of Money Adjustments:** Adjust loan values to account for the time value of money. This feature ensures that the value of a loan is adjusted over time, reflecting changes in the value of money due to factors like inflation or interest rates.

## Time Value of Money Adjustments

Hereâ€™s a summary of the different loan algorithms available in Vamak:

| Algorithm     | Description                                                                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GOLD_BASE** | Loan value is adjusted based on the price of gold. This algorithm reflects changes in gold value over time. |
| **DOLLAR_BASE** | Loan value is adjusted based on the currency value (dollar). This algorithm reflects changes in currency value over time. |
| **BUTTERFLY** | The total loan amount for each winner is divided into two parts. The first half is given initially, and the second half is provided at the end. This process continues until the middle person, who receives their loan in two consecutive months. |
| **NORMAL**    | Standard loan adjustment model without special considerations for external factors like currency or commodity values. |
